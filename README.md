# Portfolio
Get to know me and some example bioinformatics projects I have completed.

# Hi, I'm Jasper
I'm a computational biologist with a Master's in Biology (Bioinformatics and Systems Biology) from NYU. My work integrates bioinformatics, machine learning, molecular modeling, and multi-omics analysis to explore disease mechanisms and therapeutic targets.

#Skills and Tools
- **Languages:** Python, R, Bash, SQL  
- **Bioinformatics:** Kallisto, DESeq2, Bowtie2, MACS2, MEME Suite, IGV, samtools  
- **Machine Learning:** scikit-learn, XGBoost, SVM, Random Forest, Neural Net, PCA, SMOTE  
- **Pipelines:** RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, Proteomics, Data Visualization  
- **Frameworks & Systems:** Flask, Docker, AWS, Linux (HPC)

# Example Projects 
- **Neuroblastoma Proteomics Analysis** – Differential expression and survival modeling using proteomic and transcriptomic data. 
- **RNA-seq Pipeline** – Automated analysis (TrimGalore → TopHat2 → DESeq2) and downstream enrichment (MEME, GREAT, IPA).  
- **CS50 Flask App** – Web-based SQL application for healthcare data search and visualization.  
- **Machine Learning in Oncology** – MSI prediction across tumor types using Random Forest, SVM, and ensemble models.

# Interests
- AI, Machine Learning, Biology • Molecular Simulation • Integrative Multi-Omics • Computational Drug Discovery
